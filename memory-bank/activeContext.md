## 1. Current Focus

- Streamlining the Write Chat experience by routing structured AI outputs (scripts, analysis, hooks) into the slideout BlockNote editor, while keeping conversational text in the chat thread.
- Maintaining strict adherence to the Clarity Design System across new routes and interactions (spacing, radii, rings, shadows).

## 2. Recent Changes

- Implemented event-driven chat-to-editor architecture:
  - Global event `write:editor-set-content` carries `{ markdown?, blocks? }`.
  - `MinimalSlideoutEditor` listens to the event and replaces content; adds minimal markdown→blocks mapping.
  - `SlideoutWrapper` opens the slideout when the event is received.
  - `ClaudeChat` dispatches structured results (script/analysis/hooks) to the editor instead of posting to chat.
- Minor spacing/class refinements to comply with Clarity and spacing grid.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps

- Add optional toolbar actions on slideout editor: Copy/Publish pipeline and status toasts.
- Consider persisting slideout editor state to notes or drafts.
- Evaluate mobile spacing for the slideout editor (`px-11` → `px-6 md:px-11`).

## 4. Open Questions / Known Issues

- Simple markdown mapper is minimal; may need richer list/blockquote/code support.
