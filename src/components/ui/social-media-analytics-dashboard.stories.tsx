After testing 50+ productivity methods, I discovered this ONE thing that actually moves the needle. It's not another app, hack, or morning routine...

It's about changing how you think about time itself ‚è∞

const mockTranscript = `Hey everyone! So today I want to talk about something that completely changed how I approach productivity. And I know, I know - another productivity video, right? But hear me out because this isn't about another app or another morning routine.

This is about fundamentally changing how you think about time and energy management. So about six months ago, I was struggling. I was working 12-hour days, checking off tons of tasks, but I wasn't actually moving forward on the things that mattered.

I was busy, but not productive. And that's when I discovered what I call the "energy audit." Instead of managing time, I started managing my energy. Here's how it works:

First, for one week, I tracked not just what I did, but how I felt doing it. When was I most focused? When did I feel drained? When did I feel energized?

What I discovered shocked me. My most productive hours weren't in the morning like everyone says. They were actually between 2 PM and 4 PM. And my creative work? Best done at night, around 9 PM.

So I completely restructured my day around my energy patterns instead of forcing myself into someone else's ideal schedule. The result? I cut my working hours in half while doubling my output.

The key insight is this: productivity isn't about doing more things. It's about doing the right things when you have the energy to do them well. It's about working with your natural rhythms instead of against them.

Now, this doesn't mean you can't improve your energy levels. Sleep, nutrition, exercise - all of that matters. But once you have those basics down, the real game-changer is matching your tasks to your energy state.

High-energy times? That's for your most important creative work. Medium energy? That's for meetings and collaborative tasks. Low energy? That's perfect for administrative tasks and planning.

I call this the 3-2-1 method: 3 hours of high-energy work, 2 hours of medium-energy tasks, and 1 hour of low-energy activities. And you schedule them based on when you naturally have that energy level.

Try this for just one week and I guarantee you'll see a difference. Let me know in the comments how it goes for you!`
