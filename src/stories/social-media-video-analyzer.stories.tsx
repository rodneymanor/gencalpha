    transcript: `Stop wasting time with productivity advice that doesn't work. Here's what you need to do. First, let's talk about time blocking. Instead of just writing down tasks, you need to assign them specific time slots. But here's the key - color code them by energy level. High energy tasks in the morning, low energy tasks in the afternoon. Second, the two minute rule. If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Stop adding it to your to-do list. Third, batch similar tasks together. All your emails at once, all your calls at once. Your brain doesn't have to switch gears constantly. Fourth, work with your natural energy, not against it. Track when you feel most focused and schedule your hardest work then. And finally, turn off all notifications except the ones that are truly urgent. Your phone is not your boss. Try these for one week and watch your productivity skyrocket.`,
