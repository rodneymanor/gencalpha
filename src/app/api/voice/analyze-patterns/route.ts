# Voice Pattern Analysis: Hook Extraction & Script Formula Generation

Analyze these ${scriptsToAnalyze.length} scripts to extract EVERY hook pattern and create a detailed step-by-step formula for generating new scripts in this creator's style.

PRIORITY FOCUS:
1. Extract ALL hook patterns (first 10 seconds of each script)
2. Create a DETAILED timestamped formula (10+ steps)
3. Make everything UNIVERSAL (works for any topic)

KEY REQUIREMENT: Every pattern must work for cooking, fitness, tech, business, or any other topic.

## Required Analysis Components:

### 1. LINGUISTIC FINGERPRINT
Analyze and extract:
- **Lexical Patterns**: Most frequently used words (excluding common words), preferred vocabulary tier, jargon/slang usage
- **Syntactic Structures**: Sentence length distribution, clause patterns, grammatical preferences
- **Discourse Markers**: How they transition between ideas (e.g., "Now", "Alright", "So", "Trust me")
- **Rhetorical Devices**: Repetition patterns, parallel structures, contrasts, metaphors

### 2. EXTRACT HOOKS FROM ALL ${scriptsToAnalyze.length} SCRIPTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

YOU MUST INCLUDE A HOOK FROM EVERY SINGLE SCRIPT. This means:
- Script 1: Extract the opening hook
- Script 2: Extract the opening hook
- Script 3: Extract the opening hook
- Script 4: Extract the opening hook
- Script 5: Extract the opening hook
- Script 6: Extract the opening hook
- Script 7: Extract the opening hook
- Script 8: Extract the opening hook
- Script 9: Extract the opening hook
- Script 10: Extract the opening hook

For EACH hook, you MUST provide:
1. scriptNumber: The script number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. originalHook: COPY THE EXACT WORDS from the first 1-2 sentences
3. universalTemplate: Create a template with [PLACEHOLDERS] that works for ANY topic
4. type: Classify as problem/question/story/statement/warning/claim
5. trigger: Identify emotion (curiosity/frustration/fear/excitement/surprise)

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: Your "allHooksExtracted" array MUST contain at least ${scriptsToAnalyze.length} entries!

### 3. AUTHORITY BUILDING PATTERNS (Universal)
How they establish credibility without domain specifics:
- Generic authority statements: "After [TIME_PERIOD] of [DOING_THING]..."
- Results framing: "I helped [NUMBER] [TYPE_OF_PEOPLE] achieve [OUTCOME]"
- Social proof timing: When in the script they mention credentials
- Trust-building phrases that work for any expertise

### 4. TRANSITIONAL ARCHITECTURE
Map how they move through content:
- Bridge phrases between concepts (exact phrases like "The next thing you need to understand")
- Topic pivot language
- Enumeration patterns ("First", "The next tip", "My last point")
- Parenthetical aside patterns

### 5. UNIVERSAL PERSUASION FRAMEWORKS
Extract argumentation patterns that work for any topic:
- Problem agitation: "Most people [COMMON_MISTAKE] which leads to [BAD_OUTCOME]"
- Solution reveal: "The answer is actually [SIMPLER/DIFFERENT] than you think"
- Objection handling: "You might be thinking [OBJECTION] but [COUNTER]"
- CTA progression: Universal action prompts (try, test, implement, start)

### 6. MICRO-PATTERNS
Capture distinctive speech quirks:
- Filler phrases and verbal tics
- Emphasis patterns (what words they stress)
- Repetition for effect patterns
- Specific number usage (round vs specific numbers)
- Time reference patterns

### 7. UNIVERSAL NARRATIVE STRUCTURES
Story patterns that work for any domain:
- Personal story arc: "I used to [OLD_STATE] until [TURNING_POINT] now [NEW_STATE]"
- Case study structure: "[SUBJECT] had [PROBLEM], we tried [SOLUTION], result was [OUTCOME]"
- Transformation framework: "From [STARTING_POINT] to [END_POINT] in [TIMEFRAME]"
- Results presentation: How they frame any type of success (percentages, timeframes, comparisons)

### 8. EMOTIONAL CADENCE
Track emotional progression:
- Energy level changes throughout videos
- Motivational language clusters
- Empathy/relatability phrases
- Urgency creation patterns

### 9. UNIVERSAL CONTENT FORMULAS
Templates that work regardless of subject matter:
- List structure: "# [THINGS] that [OUTCOME]" - works for any domain
- Comparison: "[OPTION_A] vs [OPTION_B]: Which [DOES_WHAT] better?"
- Myth-busting: "[NUMBER] [MISCONCEPTIONS] about [TOPIC] that [HARM_PROGRESS]"
- Teaching framework: "How to [ACHIEVE_RESULT] without [COMMON_OBSTACLE]"

### 10. CLOSING PATTERNS
How they end videos:
- Summary structures
- CTA language variations
- Follow/engagement requests
- Value restatement patterns

### 11. MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP SCRIPT FORMULA (YOU MUST INCLUDE THIS!)

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE A "detailedScriptFormula" WITH EXACTLY 14 STEPS.

The formula MUST be inside "scriptGenerationRules" ‚Üí "detailedScriptFormula" and contain:

"detailedScriptFormula": {
  "step1": "[00:00-00:03] Open with [TYPE] hook using HIGH energy. Say 'If you're [PROBLEM], I'll show you [SOLUTION]'",
  "step2": "[00:03-00:05] Quick transition. Say 'Listen' or 'Alright' to maintain attention",
  "step3": "[00:05-00:08] State credibility. Say 'After [TIME] of [EXPERTISE], I discovered...'",
  "step4": "[00:08-00:10] Promise value. Say 'In the next [TIME], you'll learn [BENEFIT]'",
  "step5": "[00:10-00:15] First main point. Say 'The first thing is [POINT]'",
  "step6": "[00:15-00:20] Second main point. Say 'Next, you need to [ACTION]'",
  "step7": "[00:20-00:25] Third point/story. Say 'My client [ACHIEVED] by [METHOD]'",
  "step8": "[00:25-00:30] Address objection. Say 'You might think [OBJECTION], but [COUNTER]'",
  "step9": "[00:30-00:35] Add proof. Say '[NUMBER]% of people who [ACTION] get [RESULT]'",
  "step10": "[00:35-00:40] Comparison. Say 'Most people [WRONG_WAY], but you should [RIGHT_WAY]'",
  "step11": "[00:40-00:45] Summary. Say 'Remember: [POINT1], [POINT2], [POINT3]'",
  "step12": "[00:45-00:50] Urgency. Say 'Only [NUMBER] spots' or 'Limited time'",
  "step13": "[00:50-00:55] CTA. Say 'Comment [WORD]' or 'Link in bio'",
  "step14": "[00:55-00:60] Final hook. Say 'Next video, I'll show you [TEASER]'"
}

THIS IS MANDATORY - YOU MUST INCLUDE ALL 14 STEPS!

  }
}

Analyze with forensic precision. Remember: The goal is to create a UNIVERSAL VOICE SYSTEM that can be applied to ANY topic.

VALIDATION TEST: Every template you extract should work equally well for:
- Teaching someone to cook pasta
- Explaining cryptocurrency
- Motivating fitness routines
- Reviewing a product
- Sharing business advice

If a pattern only works for the creator's specific domain, it's TOO SPECIFIC. Extract the underlying universal structure instead.

Example:
‚ùå TOO SPECIFIC: "This workout will transform your body"
‚úÖ UNIVERSAL: "This [METHOD] will transform your [DESIRED_OUTCOME]"

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE INVALID WITHOUT THESE:

‚úÖ HOOK EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST include ${scriptsToAnalyze.length} hooks in "allHooksExtracted" array
- Each hook MUST have: scriptNumber, originalHook (exact quote), universalTemplate, type, trigger
- DO NOT skip any scripts - extract from Script 1, Script 2, Script 3... up to Script ${scriptsToAnalyze.length}

‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP FORMULA REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST include "detailedScriptFormula" inside "scriptGenerationRules"
- It MUST contain EXACTLY 14 steps (step1 through step14)
- Each step MUST have: time range, action, template phrase
- This is NOT OPTIONAL - the formula MUST be included

‚úÖ JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks)
- Use numbers not strings for numeric values
- Ensure complete JSON from opening { to closing }

FINAL CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:
‚ñ° Does "allHooksExtracted" have at least ${scriptsToAnalyze.length} entries?

Scripts to analyze (${transcripts.length} total):
