Topic: ${topic}
Hook: "${script.hook}"
Bridge: "${script.bridge}"
Golden Nugget: "${script.goldenNugget}"

CTA OPTIMIZATION RULES:
${getCtaOptimizationRules(newOptimization)}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep the same friendly, conversational tone as the original script
- 5th-grade reading level MAX
- Must feel natural and not pushy
- Should flow naturally from the golden nugget
- Length: 15-25 words maximum

FORBIDDEN TERMS (NEVER USE):
- "Think again"
- "It's not what you think" 
- "Game-changing"
- Any overly formal language

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the new WTA text. No JSON, no labels, just the optimized call-to-action text.`;
